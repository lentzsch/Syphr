## Introduction
Welcome to Syphr! Syphr is my solo capstone project from my time at App Academy. It is a messaging app that is really just a thinly veiled excuse to build a historically accurate emulation of the Enigma Machine from WWII.

## A Brief History of Enigma
If you've seen the movie "The Imitation Game" you can skip this part. The Enigma Machine was used by the Nazi's to encrypt messages. Even though the method of encryption used by Enigma was basically just a Caesar Sypher on steriods, it was considered unbreakable as it had 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (Just under 160 quintillion) different possible settings. That's difficult for even modern consumer level computers to fully brute force. This is why the father of modern computing, Alan Turing, was tapped to build a machine to crack it. "The Bombe" is that machine. It used a method called a "kown text attack" to help narrow down the potential combinations and ultimatly crack the code.
